I build components and from them compose Apps. I like to put the user first, thinking about making their experience better, even if it means more development work for myself.I'm happy working on the backend too, having recently used Node/Express but I've also worked with Ruby/Rails and PHP. I'm happiest when I can use a keyboard shortcut and love the power of the command line for running build tools, pushing commits to Github, checking logs, configuring Nginx, installing SSL certificates or writing DB queries.I always like to keep one eye on the future and I'm excited about Web Components, Service Workers and the Web being able to compete with Native experiences.",
